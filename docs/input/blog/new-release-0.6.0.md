# 0.6.0 The breaking change release
Due to misunderstanding of the requirements, the previously released version only added partial support for Cake version 0.26.0.
This release fixes that, but unfortunately includes breaking changes due to this.
It was also decided to remove all support for cake versions released prior to version 0.26.0.

## Release notes

As part of this release we had [9 commits](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Transifex/compare/0.5.0...0.6.0) which resulted in [2 issues](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Transifex/issues?milestone=7&state=closed) being closed.
